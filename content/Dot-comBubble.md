The bubble

The dot-com bubble started around 1997, peaked in 2000 and ultimately burst by 2002. As the name suggests the bubble was based on the speculation made in the stock market on internet-based companies. People started to invest blindly in internet-based companies without doing any research about the company on what are the service or products they provide.

During the crash, many online shopping companies, such as pets.com, Webvan and communication companies such as WorldCom and North point communications failed and most of them went bankrupt. Even Cisco went down by 86% and Qualcomm lost a major portion of its market capitalization.

Between 1990 and 1997 the percentage of people using computers in the USA increased from 15% to 35%, computers turned from being a luxury to becoming a necessity. This caused a major shift to Information technology and new IT companies were started.

After so many web-based companies were started, it became the talk of the Town and it was very easy to get funding from a VC or an angel investor and a lot of the dot-com companies were started.
